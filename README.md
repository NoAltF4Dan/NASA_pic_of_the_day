## API Key

This project uses NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API.

A free demo API key (`DEMO_KEY`) is available from NASA and can be used without registration:  
ðŸ”— https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY

However, for more stability and higher request limits, it's recommended to register and get your own API key at:  
ðŸ”— https://api.nasa.gov


You can export your key as an environment variable:

```bash
export NASA_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

The script will automatically use `DEMO_KEY` if no custom key is set.
